## The amount of votes that gets added each time transfer vote is called onto the "transfer" option
## 0 / commenting it out disables it
## 10 would mean every time a transfer vote is called an extra 10% of all player votes is added onto transferring
TRANSFER_PROGRESSION 0

## The maximum amount that progression can reach, examples:
## 10 would mean progression can at most add 10% of the players votes into transfer
## 99 would mean progression can eventually require every player to vote on continue or the vote transfers
## values above 100 would force the transfer vote to eventually pass, for more fine control use nova's transfer soft-cap system
TRANSFER_MAXIMUM 90
